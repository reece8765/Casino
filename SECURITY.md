## Reporting a Vulnerability

Spotted a flaw in the code? Bypassed a security prompt? Perhaps you gained virtual cash when you weren't supposed to...
Feel free to report the bug report in the "security" section of the repository, we will be happy to take a look into it!
If your security report is declined, it won't be fixed. If it's accepted, we might need more information from you.
